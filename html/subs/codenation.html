        <p>During this course I expanded my knowledge of coding and mastered some of my 		
            skills, I managed to complete all projects with plenty of time left and impressed the
            instructors. As-well as developing my coding abilities I have really grown my 			
            teamwork skills. I solved complex algorithms with javascript in the first week and 
            I worked well on group projects.</p>
